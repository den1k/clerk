;; This notebook shows how to use [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) in a Clerk viewer in order to turn the whole notebook
;; into a presentation.

;; Each set of contiguous markdown comment (`;;`) lines correspond to a single slide and so does each code block.
;;
;; We might introduce additional semantics for grouping blocks into single slides.

;; ## TODO
;; * [x] describe root notebook mode
;; * [x] use v/fetch-all in notebook viewer
;; * [ ] drop using describe-blocks in favour of a simplified with-viewer approach
;; * [x] move notebook viewer to overridable named viewer
;; * [ ] introduce custom notebook viewer here that performs slideshow transformation
;; * [ ] resuse default transform fn in order to be able to process visibility, code folding etc.
